Description:
    The scDblFinder package gathers various methods for the detection and 
    handling of doublets/multiplets in single-cell RNA sequencing data (i.e. 
    multiple cells captured within the same droplet or reaction volume). It
    includes methods formerly found in the scran package, and the new fast
    and comprehensive scDblFinder method.
